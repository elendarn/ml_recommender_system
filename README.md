# Movie Recommendation Web Application

This project aims to build a proof of concept web application that showcases different movie recommendation algorithms. The application will allow users to explore movie recommendations generated by various algorithms. The README file provides an overview of the project and guides users on how to set up and run the web application.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the DOODL Supermarket dataset used for the analysis.
- `src/`: Source code files for data preprocessing, model implementation, and MCMC simulations.
- `results/`: Output files, visualizations, and summary reports generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions for running the code.

## Prerequisites

Before running the web application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Notes

- This project serves as a proof of concept for showcasing movie recommendation algorithms. The implemented algorithms may not be the most advanced or optimal choices. Feel free to explore and enhance the recommendation algorithms as per your requirements and learning objectives.

- The web application is designed for demonstration purposes and may not include advanced features such as user registration, personalized recommendations, or real-time updates.
